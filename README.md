# COVID19-Visualizations
This repo contains some of the interesting visualizations around the COVID19 Data

Purpose:
Almost everyone on Earth and analyzed the COVID19 data. Some have even forecasted it!
But I have tried to link the number of cases with a countries population and GDP per Capita.


Data Sources:
The COVID-19 Confirmed Cases data was pulled from Johns Hopins CSSE Dataset at 7 June 2020.
GDP per Capita and Population data was pulled from Wikipedia
